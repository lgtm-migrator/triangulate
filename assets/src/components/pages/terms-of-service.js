                <p>Last revised on 2021.05.08</p>

                <h3>The Gist</h3>
                <p>Beubo operates the Triangulate.xyz service, which we hope you use. If you use it, please use it
                    responsibly. If you don't, we'll have to terminate your account.</p>

                <p>For paid accounts, you'll be charged on a monthly basis. You can cancel anytime, but there are no
                    refunds.</p>

                <p>You own the source code that you provide to Triangulate.xyz and you're responsible for keeping it
                    safe.</p>

                <p>The Terms of Service, Triangulate.xyz itself, and our prices can change at any time. We'll warn you
                    30
                    days in advance of any price changes. We'll try to warn you about major changes to the Terms of
                    Service or Triangulate.xyz, but we make no guarantees.</p>

                <p>That's the basic idea, but You must read through the entire Terms of Service below and agree with
                    all the details before You use any of our sites (whether or not you have created an account).</p>

                    agents, employees, advertisers, licensors, suppliers or partners (collectively "Beubo and
                    Partners") from and against any third party claim arising from or in any way related to (a) Your
                    breach of the Terms, (b) Your use of the Service, (c) Your violation of applicable laws, rules or
                    regulations in connection with the Service, or (d) Your Customer Source Code, including any

                    contained in the Terms (or which Beubo has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will
                    not be taken to be a formal waiver of Beubo's rights and that those rights or remedies will
                    still be available to Beubo.</p>

                <p>Beubo shall not be liable for failing or delaying performance of its obligations resulting from
